**Light-On-Off**
In this repository, I made a simple project by using HTML,CSS & Javascript.If you see the project,you can see the two button.These are:Turn on button and Turn off button.At the middle you can see a image of a light.




**How I made this?**
First, I put Turn On button,a white light and a Turn Off button.Then I create a function in the Javascript file.After this I used addEventListener method and passed onclick reference and called out a fat arrow function ..
